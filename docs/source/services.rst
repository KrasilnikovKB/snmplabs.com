SNMP Labs is a one man show - `I <https://github.com/etingof>`_ stand
behind everything you can find on this site.

I've started a bunch of SNMP-related projects many years ago just because there
was virtually no implementation I needed back then. Over time, my initially toy
projects gained popularity especially in the Telecom spheres.

All my projects are open source and free, anyone can take the code and
do `anything <http://snmplabs.com/license.html>`_ about it.

To date, the `portfolio <http://snmplabs.com/#our-projects>`_ of my
SNMP-related libraries and tools has grown beyond the budget of my free
time. I am sort of struggling to keep them well-maintained and further
developed.

In effort to buy more time for my projects, I'm offering consulting and
development services to anyone who is looking to:

* bring new features to any of `snmplabs.com <http://snmplabs.com/#our-projects>`_ projects
* priority issue resolution
* integration with other systems

or whatever need comes up.

Do not hesitate to `reach out <mailto:etingof@gmail.com>`_ - I am always
happy to help!
